This application is built against version 1.7 of the Kinect SDK, downloaded from  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36996

If you bought the kinect as part of an xbox package then you need to buy an adapter to fit it to PC USB: http://amzn.to/10wbZUm.  If you buy the kinect separately, it may come with an adapter already: http://amzn.to/anD1Jk
